# Support

🍀 Lucky for you, I am not throwing out code in the open source world without also providing active maintenance and support for it.

## ❓ Question

1. Have you tried?  
2. Have you read the available documentation and the [issues list history](https://github.com/elarivie/atom-python-linters/issues)?
3. Do you still have a question?


If the answers are YES than do not hesitate to create a [new issue](https://github.com/elarivie/atom-python-linters/issues) for your question.  You are probably not the only one in that situation.  I monitor the issues list and answer in a timely manner.

If you prefer — you may also write me an email at ericlariviere@hotmail.com

## 💡 Suggestion
If you have suggestions you may create a [new issue](https://github.com/elarivie/atom-python-linters/issues) describing your idea or even better you could [contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## 🐞Bug
