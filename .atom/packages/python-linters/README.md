This [atom][atom homepage] package is a All-In-One linter for [python][python homepage] code, it internally use multiple linting tools:

- [flake8][flake8 homepage]
- [mypy][mypy homepage]
- [pydocstyle][pydocstyle homepage]
- [pylint][pylint homepage]

The lint triggers of all of those linting tools can individually be configure to
* `Lint as you type`
* `Lint on file save`
* `Never`

You don't need to install all of those lint tool if you don't want/need them.  If any of the above lint tool is not install, it will be detected and a user friendly message will guide you to either install it or change its lint trigger to 'Never'.

To provide specific lint options, python-linters supports setup.cfg configuration file format <a href="http://renesd.blogspot.com/2017/02/setupcfg-solution-to-python-config-file.html">which is supported by all of the above lint tool</a>.

Having lint options in a file external to the IDE settings allows to share the configuration with other process like manual run or CI and therefore obtain consistent lint results.

## Prerequisites

- [atom](https://atom.io/) must be installed which will provide the apm command aka *Atom Package Manager*.

## Installation steps

	apm install python-linters

## ‚éá Alternatives

Use the following atom linting packages:
- https://atom.io/packages/linter-flake8
- https://atom.io/packages/linter-mypy
- https://atom.io/packages/linter-pydocstyle
- https://atom.io/packages/linter-pylint

**Note:** You can use any of the above alternate linting packages in parallel with python-linters.
In which case you should set their lint trigger setting to `Never` to avoid double processing.
