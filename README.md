# atom-IDE
My Atom IDE settings

File location:
`~/.atom/config.cson`


Commando to copy .atm and its subdirectories and files to repo:
`cp -r .atom ./Documents/repos/atom-IDE/`

 in order to track a common list of installed packages, at the terminal shell execute:
`$ apm list --installed --bare > ~/.atom/package.list`

To install the packages automatically back into a fresh installation of Atom:
`$ apm install --packages-file ~/.atom/package.list`
